This workshop made me more familiar with the previously semi-understood modularity. 
Now, I better understand why we organize certain functions in one file while others go in a different one.
Apart from modularity, I also got to work with CSV files. In IPC144, I wasn't so good at understanding and
learning file reading, but this workshop has forced me to get better at it. I have removed many redundant 
functions that didn't have any use in the way I coded this project, so I have eliminated them. In total, I 
have created seven of my own functions and used some from the preexisting io module. I removed all the prior 
functions in the graph module; however, I used a lot of code from them to create the functions that replaced 
them. One tricky part for me was figuring out how the graphs were being printed; I was constantly overlooking
the 'int barLength = GRAPH_WIDTH * val / max;' in the graph.cpp file. The other hurdle I encountered was with
the 'categorizing' function, but after much head-scratching, I was able to figure that out as well."
